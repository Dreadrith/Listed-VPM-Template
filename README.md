# Listed-VPM-Template
This repo was made real quick for personal use but feel free to use it too.<br>
This is the essentials to get a repo package listed in the page you make from https://github.com/vrchat-community/template-package-listing <br>

## Instructions
1. Use this template to make your own repository. Can be private but public later.<br>
2. Replace the appropriate/example things in every file:
	- .git/release.yml - Just lines 7 to 11  
	- package.json, CHANGELOG.md, LICENSE.md  
	- Assembly Definitions file names AND 'Name' (click on it)  
	- Documentation~/com.dreadscripts.example (File name too!)  

3. Delete script folders, documentation, CHANGELOG and LICENSE if they're unused.<br>
4. Make it public, then go to your listing repository and add the repo you made from this template to 'source.json' under 'githubRepos'.<br>
5. Done!

## WARNING
For the .unitypackage to build properly with Github actions, you need to include the .meta files for the package.<br>
This is slightly customized to fit my liking with the naming and versioning so who knows if it'll bite in the butt later.<br>
